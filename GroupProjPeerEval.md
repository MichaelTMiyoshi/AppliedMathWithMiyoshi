# Group Project Peer Evaluation

Working in groups does not mean that each group member will necessarily receive the same score.  Each member of the group must fill out a peer evaluation of each of the other members in the group according to the following criteria.  This will be taken into consideration along with the observations of the instructor to distribute points to each group member.

Score | Description
----- | -----------
0- | The group member did not contribute to the project.  And/or the group member distracted from the group effort.
0+ | The group member contributed minimally to the project.
1 | 
2 | The group member gave some worthy contributions to the effort.
3 | The group member was an integral part of the effort.
4 | The group member was indespensible.  The project would not have been completed without the group member.
