# Explanation: Percent Difference

Percent difference is used to find out how close you are to some standard.  The smaller the percent difference (positive or negative), the closer you are to your desired answer or outcome.

## Relevance

Percent difference can be used in many situations.  For example, you could use it to determine if you are getting better at estimation.  All you would need to do is figure out the percent difference between your estimate and the actual.  Then, keep track of this percent difference over time to see if you are getting better or not.

## Procedure

To find a percent difference (how close we are), we need to first consider what our standard is.  Now, this will be different for different scenarios.  For instance, if you are measuring distances or angles, you might have a known distance or angle that is your standard.  In some cases, you might need to decide what your standard is.  For instance, you might have distance and angle measures when you are finding trig functions.  In this case, you would need to choose whether you are calling your distance or your angle measures as your standard.  The cases where it is easy is when somebody tells you the standard or it is obvious what your standard is.  Other times, you need to pick one and stick with it.  (Or you will be told which is the standard, and you will need to stick with it.)

The easiest way to think of percent difference is with an example.  I will use a variable called X.  There will be two values of X.  I will call the standard value of X, X<sub>s</sub>.  I will call the test (often measured) value of X, X<sub>m</sub>.

To get the value of our percent difference (% diff), we first subtract our test (or measured) value from our standard value.  I like to just call this our difference (diff).  The equation is:

```diff = X<sub>s</sub> - X<sub>m</sub>```

Note that the difference can be a negative value.  Make sure that you keep the negative sign if you have a negative difference (diff).

Next, we will divide the difference by the standard value.  I will call this the normalized difference, diff<sub>norm</sub>

```diff<sub>norm</sub> = diff / X<sub>s</sub>```

Then, we can find the percent difference (% diff) by multiplying by 100 and placing a percent sign (%) after it.

```% diff = diff<sub>norm</sub> * 100 %```

If you would like to make a table for the values and calculations, you could make something like the following:

X<sub>s</sub> | X<sub>m</sub> | difference (diff) | normalized decimal difference | % difference
------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------
standard (X<sub>s</sub>) | test (measured) <Xsub>m</sub> | diff = X<sub>s</sub> - X<sub>m</sub> | diff<sub>norm</sub> = diff / X<sub>s</sub> | %diff = diff<sub>norm</sub> * 100%
X<sub>s</sub> = 40.25 in. | X<sub>m</sub> = 40 in | diff = 40.25 in. - 40 in. = 0.25 in. | diff<sub>norm</sub> = 0.25 in. / 40.25 in. = 0.0062 | %diff = 0.0062 * 100% = 0.62%

The last line of the table is a simple example.

One note about using a calculator to find %diff.  When you find the percent difference, the percent sign (%) in the equation is not used in your calculator.  It is just a symbol you use when recording your findings.  If you multiply any number in your calculator by 100%, it is the same as multiplying by 1.  So make sure that when you multiply on your calculator you just multiply by 100 and when recording the value, put the percent sign (%) behind it.  You can make sure you did not make this error by looking at the diff<sub>n</sub> and %diff and making sure they are not the exact same number.  Remember, the % sign is just a notation.
