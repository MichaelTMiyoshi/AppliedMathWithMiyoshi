# Project: Was Pythagoras Right?

This is an individual project done in groups.  You are going to measure the sides of right triangles.  Then, you will do calculations to see how close your calculations are to your measurements.  It will be done in two parts.  Part 1 is the measuring of triangle sides.  Part 2 is calculating the sides and comparing the calculated to the measured.

Tools needed:
* Paper
* Writing utensil
* Tape measure for the group
* Calculator (for part 2)

## Part 1 - Measuring (10)

You need to split your paper into three columns as shown below.

Sketch and Lengths | Relationship | How Close Is C?
------------------ | ------------ | ---------------
Draw and label 10 right triangles | Can you determine a mathematical relationship between the three sides a, b, and c? | Calculate c from the relationship and determine how close the calculated value is the to the measured value

You will measure the three sides of 10 right triangles.  Measure to the nearest 1/8".  (You should get better results if you measure to the nearest 1/16", but to the nearest 1/8" is acceptable.)

You can use a figure like the following.  Notice that the longest side is labeled c.  This is called the hypotenuse.

          |\
          | \
          |  \
     b    |   \   c
          |    \
          |     \
          |      \
          --------
              a

## Part 2 - Calculations and Comparisons (20)

See if you can deterine the relationship between the sides.  It may or may not be obvious.  Or you might remember the person we are trying to prove right, Pythagoras.

Okay.  Now that you have had a little time to think, here is the relationship.  It is called the Pythagorean Theorem.  It says that the measure of the hypotenuse squared is equal to the sum of each leg squared.

$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$

So when we solve for c, we get:

$c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$

Now, to find out how close we are, we need to consider which is our standard and subtract and divide from it and convert this to a percentage.  This will be done in a few steps below.  But first a couple conventions on notation.

We will use the measured as the standard.  So c<sub>m</sub> will represent the measured value of c (the hypotenuse) and c<sub>c</sub> will represent the calculated value of c.

If you would like to make a table for the values and calculations, you could make something like the following:

c<sub>m</sub> | c<sub>c</sub> | difference (diff) | normalized decimal difference | % difference
------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------
The measured hypotenuse (c<sub>m</sub>) | c<sub>c</sub> $= \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ | diff = c<sub>m</sub> - c<sub>c</sub> | diff<sub>n</sub> = diff / c<sub>m</sub> | %diff = diff<sub>n</sub> * 100%
c<sub>m</sub> = 40.25 in. | c<sub>c</sub> =40 in | diff = 40.25 in. - 40 in. = 0.25 in. | diff<sub>n</sub> = 0.25 in. / 40.25 in. = 0.0062 | %diff = 0.0062 * 100% = 0.62%

The last line of the table is an example where the measured values of a right triangle were:

sides | measurements
----- | -----------:
a | 24 inches
b | 32 inches
c | 40.25 inches

One note about using a calculator to find %diff.  When you find the percent difference, the percent sign (%) in the equation is not used in your calculator.  It is just a symbol you use when recording your findings.  If you multiply any number in your calculator by 100%, it is the same as multiplying by 1.  So make sure that when you multiply on your calculator you just multiply by 100 and when recording the value, put the percent sign (%) behind it.  You can make sure you did not make this error by looking at the diff<sub>n</sub> and %diff and making sure they are not the exact same number.
