# Project: Moving Out

You are planning on moving out on your own.  In order to do so, you will need a job and money.  (Although this exercise could be done in many ways (including using a spreadsheet), you are going to do it by creating functions.)

## Deliverables:

Create functions and draw their graphs using appropriate units.  Also give the domain (x or t) and range (y) for each function.  Make sure to use different function names for each function.  You may need more functions than those shown.

### Function of daily spending (running total) (10):

The first thing you will need to do is create a function of your daily spending as a running total.  (A running total is the sum of all the money going out).  How much money goes out?  The x-axis will be your time.  (So it is better to label it as t.)  Your y-axis will be your outflow of money.  So you can think of the graph you create as a function of t called m(t).  (The m could stand for money.)  You can use a standard notation of f(x) or f(t), or you can even use words to name your function (spending(t)).  Even though you may not spend money exactly the same way every day, create a fairly representative function of your spending for a full 24 hours.  If you drive, you will need to think of using gas as spending.  Think about what gas mileage your car gets and create a driving portion of your function based on that average.

### Functions of monetary needs (budget) (30):

You will need to create different functions for 2 years of different monetary needs.  Specifically, you will need separate functions for:

| Monthly costs |
| :---          |
| Rent (including costs to start a lease – first month’s rent, last month’s rent, damage deposit).  For the second year increase your monthly rate by 5%. |
| Food |
| Utilities (electric, phone, etc.) |
| Fuel and/or public transportation fees |
| Entertainment (including streaming services) |

### Functions for saving (prior to moving out) (20):

Decide how much you will save prior to moving out.  Create a linear function that shows weeks of constant savings and a linear function that shows the accumulation of savings at a constant rate per week.

### Function for income (20):

Do some research on a job that you think you will be qualified for when you graduate (or when you finish other schooling).  If you do not have ideas on this, you may use the local minimum wage as your wage.  Create a function of earning (y-axis) versus time (x-axis) for a week.  Your maximum hours worked can be up to 60 hours.  If you work beyond 40 hours, you start to earn overtime (use 1.5 times your wage).

### Comparison (10):

Some people work two jobs for various reasons.  (Usually because they cannot get enough hours in either job.)  Draw a function of one job at 60 hours versus two jobs (with the same wage as each other) in such a way that the two jobs and the one job earn the same amount of money.  What is the wage of the two jobs (30 hours each) that is required to earn the same amount of money per week as the single job earning overtime (40 hours regular time + 20 hours overtime)?

### Answer the following questions (10):
How long will it take you to save up enough money to be able to pay for your living expenses?

Can you put the different functions on the same graph to show a graph of the total expenses?  How would you do that?

How are the two linear functions for savings related?

How long will it take you to save up enough money to move out on your own?

### Extension (10):

Use a spreadsheet to show the graphs after you make your own hand-drawn graphs of your functions.

## Notes:

This is an individual project.  You can, of course, help each other, but do not just copy each other.  (I would actually prefer that everybody in the class uses different rents, wages, etc.)

Make your project beautiful.  Your functions and graphs should be readable with labels and units.  Use a straight edge for your manually created graphs.

The extension is not part of the total.  It can add to your points, but you cannot receive more than the maximum points for the project (per current school policy).

The [grading rubric](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/AppliedMathWithMiyoshi/blob/main/GradingCriteria.md) will be used to grade each section.
