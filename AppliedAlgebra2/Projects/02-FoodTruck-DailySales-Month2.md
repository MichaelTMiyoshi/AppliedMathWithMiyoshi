# 02 - Food Truck - Daily Sales - Month 2

This file has the random amounts of sales that you will have during each of four weeks.  The outcomes for each day are determined by 12 possible outcomes.  These outcomes are determined by chance.  The chance is determined by two factors.  The first factor is a decision of whether to use a 12-sided die (1-12) or a pair of 6-sided dice (2-12).  There is a one in three chance that the 12-sided die will be used.

The file [02-FoodTruck-DailyLottery.xlsx](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/AppliedMathWithMiyoshi/blob/main/AppliedAlgebra2/Projects/02-FoodTruck-DailyLottery.xlsx) can be used to give different outcomes.  When you download it, you will get a new set of random numbers each time you open the file.  You can get a set of specific outcomes by copying the outcomes and copying the values with a paste special.  (The values below were saved in the files below the randomly generated outcomes.)

The possible outcomes below are the outcomes based on the rolls of dice (or single 12-sided die).

Roll | Outcome
---- | -------
1 | You sell between 50% and 59% of your inventory.
2 | Your waste for the day was between 6% and 12% (CoGS).  But you sold 85% and 92% of your inventory.
3 | You sell between 75% and 84% of your inventory.
4 | You sell 75% and 90% of your inventory.
5 | You sell out 1 hour after closing.
6 | People continue to line up at closing.  You sell out 1/2 hour after closing.
7 | You sell out within 10 minutes of closing.
8 | You sell out your inventory 1 hour before closing.  You must decide whether to pay your employees for that hour or not.
9 | You sell out your inventory 2 hours before closing.  You must decide whether to pay your employees for that hour or not.
10 | You sell 91% and 96% of your inventory.
11 | You sell 82% and 92% of your inventory.
12 | Power outage.  You take inventory to a homeless shelter.  The amount of your inventory you take to the shelter is between 10% and 60% (six possible multiples of 10%).

The possible outcomes for each day (28 days) are in the table below.  Unfortunately, days 7, 14, 21, and 28 are not days when you will be working.  You will only work 6 days and the seventh day will be used to make predictions for the week to come.

You will use these outcomes to calculate your daily income and determine whether you make money or not.  You will use the first month of income (and expenses) to make predictions and decide how many items you will prepare each day for sale.

You will use these outcomes for your second "month" of operation.

There are also some chance happenings that will happen each week.  The possible outcomes are decided by a roll of a single six-sided die.  They are listed below:

Week | Roll | Outcome
---- | ---- | -------
1	Illness - Lose 3 consecutive days of income for the week or hire a second person at the same rate for the whole week.
2	If you did not sell out all six days of the week, increase your lowest two days of sales by between 3% and 6%, up to a maximum of 100%.
3	You had a problem with your truck and need to pay between $800 and $1200.
4	If you did not sell out all six days of the week, increase your lowest two days of sales by 3% and 6%, up to a maximum of 100%.
5	Employee turnover (somebody quit and you need to hire somebody else).  Lose 3% and 8% of income for three consecutive days.
6	Bonus!  You are invited to a special event.  Sell between 150% and 200% of inventory for two consecutive days.

These particular outcomes are listed below:

Week | Roll | Outcome
---- | ---- | -------
1 | 2 | If you did not sell out all six days of the week, increase your lowest two days of sales by 3%, up to a maximum of 100%.
2 | 3 | You had a problem with your truck and need to pay $1135.
3 | 5 | Employee turnover (somebody quit and you need to hire somebody else).  Lose 8% of income for three consecutive days.
4 | 6 | Bonus!  You are invited to a special event.  Sell 167% of inventory for two consecutive days.

Of course, you can game the system since you know what the outcomes will be.  However, you would do best to run the simulation as you might like to run a business.  You will not know the future in a real business.  So think about that as you plan each week's inventory.  The goal in running a food truck is to get the greatest return for your investment.  The goal for the simulation is to give you an idea of how to calculate your income and costs and to give you an idea on how to plan for the future using this data.
