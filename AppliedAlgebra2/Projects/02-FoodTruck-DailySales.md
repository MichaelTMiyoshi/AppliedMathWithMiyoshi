# 02 - Food Truck - Daily Sales

This file has the random amounts of sales that you will have during each of four weeks.  The outcomes for each day are determined by 12 possible outcomes.  These outcomes are determined by chance.  The chance is determined by two factors.  The first factor is a decision of whether to use a 12-sided die (1-12) or a pair of 6-sided dice (2-12).  There is a one in three chance that the 12-sided die will be used.

The file [02-FoodTruck-DailyLottery.xlsx](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/AppliedMathWithMiyoshi/blob/main/AppliedAlgebra2/Projects/02-FoodTruck-DailyLottery.xlsx) can be used to give different outcomes.  When you download it, you will get a new set of random numbers each time you open the file.  You can get a set of specific outcomes by copying the outcomes and copying the values with a paste special.  (The values below were saved in the files below the randomly generated outcomes.)

The possible outcomes below are the outcomes based on the rolls of dice (or single 12-sided die).

Roll | Outcome
---- | -------
1 | You sell 59% of your inventory.
2 | Your waste for the day was 11% (CoGS).  But you sold 85% of your inventory.
3 | You sell 78% of your inventory.
4 | You sell 85% of your inventory.
5 | You sell out 1 hour after closing.
6 | People continue to line up at closing.  You sell out 1/2 hour after closing.

10 | You sell 92% of your inventory.
11 | You sell 91% of your inventory.

The possible outcomes for each day (28 days) are in the table below.  Unfortunately, days 7, 14, 21, and 28 are not days when you will be working.  You will only work 6 days and the seventh day will be used to make predictions for the week to come.

You will use these outcomes to calculate your daily income and determine whether you make money or not.  You will use the first month of income (and expenses) to make predictions and decide how many items you will prepare each day for sale.
