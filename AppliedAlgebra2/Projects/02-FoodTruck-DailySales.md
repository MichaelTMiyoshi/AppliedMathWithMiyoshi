# 02 - Food Truck - Daily Sales

This file has the random amounts of sales that you will have during each of four weeks.  The outcomes for each day are determined by 12 possible outcomes.  These outcomes are determined by chance.  The chance is determined by two factors.  The first factor is a decision of whether to use a 12-sided die (1-12) or a pair of 6-sided dice (2-12).  There is a one in three chance that the 12-sided die will be used.

The possible outcomes for the day are in the table below.

1 | You sell 59% of your inventory.
2 | Your waste for the day was 11% (CoGS).  But you sold 85% of your inventory.
3 | You sell 78% of your inventory.
