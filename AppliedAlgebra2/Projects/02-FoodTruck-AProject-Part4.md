# Project: Operating a Food Truck

You are planning to open a food truck.  Your plan is simple.  Make one food item very well.  This food item will have only four ingredients (I know this is unrealistic, but it will work for the sake of the simulation).

The files associated with this simulation are in the projects folders with the naming convention 02-FoodTruck.

The project will be broken up into 4 parts and each part will be turned in separately.  They may also be turned in together at the end, but each portion will go into the gradebook at set times.

## Part 4 - Questions and Conclusions (10)

Now that you have operated for two months, you can draw some conclusions and answer a question or two about the simulation experience.  (Yes, simulations can be done without a computer.)  By the way, one or more of these (or questions like them) might make great test questions.

1. There is obviously more to opening a business than this short simulation shows.  But even so, would you open a food truck if the operation was as simple as it seemed in the simulation?  Why or why not?  (Back up your conclusion with data from your simulation.)
2. If you decided that you want your 1 food item in your food truck to have a price of $12 and you want to keep your Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS) at $7.  Without your meat, the costs are set at $5.50.  Suppose you get your meat at $8.00 per pound.  What is the maximum number of ounces of meat you can put in your product to keep your CoGS at $7?  (Remember that there are 16 ounces in a pound.)
3. Some entrepreneurs take only a straight wage (or no wage at all) and put much (or all) of their net proceeds back into their business.  If you did this, you can keep unexpected costs at bay.  Would you pay yourself a straight wage or take the money and pay for unexpected costs out of pocket when they arise?
4. Nothing was ever done with taxes, even though they were mentioned.  That is because you would just calculate the sales tax based on your income (not the net).  Sales taxes are done in different ways depending on where you operate.  How much sales tax would you pay for the two months you were in operation?  (Hint: Just find your total income for the two months and multiply by the sales tax rate.  If you want a specific rate to use, you can use 9%, the rate in my area when I wrote this.)
5. The tables used for this simulation could be done using a spreadsheet or accounting software.  What is the purpose of doing them by hand?  (Hint:  How will you know if your software has done the calculations correctly?)

Points:  Points are earned by answering the questions and drawing conclusions based on the data you have created.

Some of the formulas for daily amounts that you used are repeated below:

```
CoGS = (PriceIngredient1 + PriceIngredient2 + PriceIngredient3 + PriceIngredient4 + PriceIngredient5) * NumberOfInventoryProducts
Payroll = Rate * HoursPerDay
MonthlyOverhead = TruckPayment + Utilities + Licensing
DailyOverhead = MonthlyOverhead / DaysWorking
Income = NumberOfProductsSold * ConsumerPrice
Net = Income - (CoGS + Payroll + DailyOverhead)
```
