# Project: Operating a Food Truck

You are planning to open a food truck.  Your plan is simple.  Make one food item very well.  This food item will have only four ingredients (I know this is unrealistic, but it will work for the sake of the simulation).

The files associated with this simulation are in the projects folders with the naming convention 02-FoodTruck.

The project will be broken up into 4 parts and each part will be turned in separately.  They may also be turned in at the end, but each portion will go into the gradebook at set times.

## Part 1 - Research (20)

Determine what four ingredients you will be using for your food item.  You are only going to create one food item.  The premise is that you are going to do that one food item well.  The first thing to do is find out what the cost of each of your four items will be for a single serving.  Then, you will decide what the cost you will charge to your customers.
