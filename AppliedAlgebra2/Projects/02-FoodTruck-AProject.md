# Project: Operating a Food Truck

You are planning to open a food truck.  Your plan is simple.  Make one food item very well.  This food item will have only four ingredients (I know this is unrealistic, but it will work for the sake of the simulation).

The files associated with this simulation are in the projects folders with the naming convention 02-FoodTruck.

The project will be broken up into 4 parts and each part will be turned in separately.  They may also be turned in at the end, but each portion will go into the gradebook at set times.

## Part 1 - Research (20)

Determine what four ingredients you will be using for your food item.  You are only going to create one food item.  The premise is that you are going to do that one food item well.  The first thing to do is find out what the cost of each of your four items will be for a single serving.  Then, you will decide what the cost you will charge to your customers.

You will need to do some research for this portion, but your aim is to fill out the price worksheet and minimum sales.  (Note: Using the example numbers will earn you a maximum of 75% of the maximum points.)

The purpose of the pricing worksheet is to determine the price of your single food item.  My example choice is to make tacos.  My example just uses small portions of the ingredients.  I also determined that my secret spice is going to cost a specific dollar amount per item (taco).  You will want to find the costs of your four ingredients and then determine how much will go into your food item.  Ideally, you would do some experimenting to determine the amounts.  (You would make your tacos and weigh ingredients.)  My example just uses guesses.  Probably low guesses.

As a retailer, you would have access to lower prices than I have listed.  But this example just uses retail prices that I found online at a major retail food seller.

Item | Amount | Cost
---- | ------ | ---:
Meat | 1 pound | $10.99
Iceburg Lettuce | head | $2.99
Cheddar Cheese | 2 pounds | $14.99
Tortilla | 80 count | $5.99

I decided that each taco would take 0.5 ounces of meat (there are 16 ounces in a pound).  Each head of lettuce could be divided into 20 tacos.  Each taco would also have 0.5 ounces of cheese.  And there would be 1 tortilla per taco.

The math is then as follows.

Item | Calculation | Cost / item
---- | ----------- | ----------:
Meat | $10.99 / 32 = $0.3434 | $0.35
Iceburg Lettuce | $2.99 / 20 = 0.1495 | $0.15
Cheddar Cheese | $14.99 / 64 = 0.2342 | $0.25
Tortilla | $5.99 / 80 = $0.074875 | $0.08
Secret Spice | $0.50 | $0.50

For the meat and cheese, realize that there are 16 ounces in a pound.  And if each taco will receive 0.5 ounces, that means that the meat will make 32 tacos (16 ounces / 0.5 ounces per taco = 32 tacos).  The cheese comes in 2 pound blocks, but there is still only going to be 0.5 ounces per taco.  A two pound block will produce 64 tacos (32 ounces / 0.5 ounces per taco = 64 tacos).

I rounded up several items to more convenient cent amounts.

Pricing Worksheet - cost of ingredients per item (taco)

Item | Cost per item
---- | ------------:
Meat | $0.35
Lettuce | $0.15
Cheese | $0.25
Tortilla | $0.08
Secret Spice | $0.50
Total | $1.33

The worksheet is laid out so that the markup is next.  However, I decided that I would rather decide the price of the item first and then determine the markup.  I decided that I would have each order be 2 tacos and the cost of each order would be $10.00  With a sales tax of 9.0%, the cost plus tax would be $10.90 (do not worry about the tax yet).  Markup is just the cost to the consumer minus the cost of goods sold.  So the markup for the 2 tacos (1 order) would be $10.00 - $2.66 = $7.34.  (Remember that the $2.66 comes from 2 tacos costing $1.33 each.)

So the rest of the worksheet would be as follows.

Note | Amount
---- | -----:
Markup of 2 tacos per order | $7.34
Final cost to consumer (without sales tax) | $10.00
Final cost with 9.0% sales tax | $10.90
