# Essential Standards

A workshop leader explained to the audience that an essential standard is something that you would be horrified to know that a student who took your class did not know.  It might be a big concept or not.  But it is essential that every student knows.  I kept this in mind when I came up with the following essential standards for my Applied Math classes.

Students shall:
1. Model the world mathematically
1. Solve complex problems, even those that they have not previously seen
1. Use and prepare data for analysis, prediction, and planning
1. Have number sense
1. Use logic and reason to argue positions and support proofs

Students will show that they have met these standards in various ways.  They will produce products, pass tests, and present what they know in various ways.  A rubric or set of criteria will show that they have met these standards.  (The rubrics have not yet been created, but specifics for these essential standards are shown in pages for Applied Geometry and Applied Algebra 2.
