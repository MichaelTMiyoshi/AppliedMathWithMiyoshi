# Grading Rubric (Grading Criteria)

The grading criteria below is how problems, projects, and labs will be graded.  Each problem or project will have different points associated with it, so different numerical values will be given.  But the percentages will be assigned based on the criteria below.  Notice that an honest effort to solve a problem must be given to accumulate points.  That means that you must have some sort of mathematical process written down.  Also note that a solution must have some process associated with it.  That is true for all problems except with multiple choice type questions.

Free Response Problems

Score | Percent | Description
----- | ------- | -----------
0- | 0 | No answer given.  No solution is attempted.
0+ | 50 | An honest effort to solve the problem is given.
1 | 62.5% | Answer is incorrect.  Solution has some correct elements.
2 | 75% | Answer is incorrect.  Solution has minor mathematical or logical error(s).  Or answer is correct, but no work is shown.
3 | 87.5% | Answer is correct.  Solution has minor error(s).  OR  Answer is incorrect, but solution is done correctly.
4 | 100% | Answer is correct.  Solution is done correctly.

Multiple Choice Problems

Score | Percent | Description
----- | ------- | -----------
0- | 0 | No answer given.  No solution is attempted.
0+ | 50 | The incorrect choice is made.
4 | 100% | The correct choice is made.

## Note to teachers and other interested parties

If you would like to know more about why I have a minimum grade of 50% for those giving an honest effort to solving problems, doing projects, and other work, see the book <i>Grading for Equity: What It Is, Why It Matters, and How It Can Transform Schools and Classrooms</i> by Joe Feldman.

I have modified some of the practices there to fit my classes and philosophies, but Feldman gives at least one interesting argument for the 50% minimum grade.  Simply that if we have a 90-80-70-60 grading scale, there are 60 points to fail and only 40 points to succeed.  The other notion that I think is valid is that the obstacle of a failing grade seems more surmountable when there is a shorter hill to climb.  Getting from 50 to 60 is much more doable than getting from 0 to 60.  And no.  I am not promoting any books here.  I just want people to be aware of some of the resources I use.  Either to edify myself as a teacher or that I use in my classroom.  Students can also look at these resources to educate themselves.  (I also want to give credit where credit is due.)
