# Grading Rubric (Grading Criteria)

The grading criteria below is how problems, projects, and labs will be graded.  Each problem or project will have different points associated with it, so different numerical values will be given.  But the percentages will be assigned based on the criteria below.  Notice that an honest effort to solve a problem must be given to accumulate points.  That means that you must have some sort of mathematical process written down.  Also note that a solution must have some process associated with it.  That is true for all problems except with multiple choice type questions.
