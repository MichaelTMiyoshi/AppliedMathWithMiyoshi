# Applied Geometry Essential Standards

It is my goal that every student who takes Applied Geometry from me has the following essential standards.

Students shall:
1. Model the world mathematically
1. Solve complex problems, even those that they have not previously seen
1. Use and prepare data for analysis, prediction, and planning
1. Have number sense
1. Use logic and reason to argue positions and support proofs

Students need to do the following to demonstrate that they are meeting those standards.  As of this writing, these are not complete rubrics, but rather working definitions for the rubrics to come.

## Students shall model the world mathematically.
*	Identify geometric entities
*	Draw and construct geometric figures
*	Compute area, volume, and surface area of figures

## Students shall solve complex problems, even those they have not previously seen.
*	Use problem solving techniques to solve problems.
*	Solve systems of equations

## Students shall use and prepare data for analysis, prediction, and planning.
*	Gather data
*	Create tables, graphs, charts
*	Recognize patterns
*	Predict trends
*	Make plans based on data

## Students shall have number sense.
*	Make estimates
*	Use simple (and complex) mathematic operations to determine answers
*	Understand domain and range and how they are applicable to problems

## Students shall use logic and reason to argue positions and support proofs.
*	Analyze and meet criteria / requirements
*	Create geometric proofs
