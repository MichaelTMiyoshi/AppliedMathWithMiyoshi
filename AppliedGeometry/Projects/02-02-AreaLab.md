# Area Lab

What is area?  Simply put, it is the second of two measures of a 2-dimentional (2D) figure.  Where perimeter measures how far it is to go around the outside of the figure, area is a measure of how much material you would need to cover the figure.  It is the amount of stuff that makes up the figure.  It is important to know how to calculate the area of an object.  Any object.  A simple example as to why we want to know the area of something is to figure out how much material you need to cover an object or how much sod you will need to cover the grassy area of your yard.

Materials:

You will need the following:
* Paper
* Writing utensil
* Ruler (or tape measure)
* Objects

You will have several wooden (or other material) objects.  They are 3D, but you are going to find the area of the main (largest) shape.  You may measure in inches (in) or centimeters (cm) or whatever units the ruler (tape measure) has.  You will work in groups to gather the data, and you will need each other to figure out the area.

For the area lab, you will label the vertices (corners) rather than the edges of the figures.  Notice how the vertices are labeled sequentially (in order) as you go around the figure.

Create a table on your paper with three columns.  The left-most column will be for a sketch of your figure.  The middle column will be a count of square units.  The last column will be an estimate of the calculation of the area of the figure.

Sketch | Count of square units | Calculated Area
------ | --------------------- | ---------------
Labeled sketch | count | calculated area (approximate)
Labeled sketch | count | calculated area (approximate)
Labeled sketch | count | calculated area (approximate)

Your goal is to sketch, measure, and calculate the area for 5 figures.  My suggestion is to sketch, label, and measure first (in the first half of the class).  Then do the calculations.

The measuring of the area will be done by counting.  How will you do that?  I am glad you asked.  You are going to cut out squares of varying size.  The sizes will be 1" x 1", 2" x 2", 3" x 3" and 4" x 4".  You may also cut out rectangles with similar distances (1" x 2", 1" x 3", 1" x 4", 2" x 3", 2" x 4", etc.).  You will need to figure out how much area each of these figures has.  (The area of a rectangle is length x width.)  Then, figure out how many of your square and rectangular figures fit on the figure.  You may need to move your squares and rectangle around.  You might even need to approximate partial squares or rectangle so that they fit your figure.  Count up how many square units (probably inches) your figures have.

You will need to do some measuring and math to calculate the areas.  The easiest thing to do is imagine the figures are a collection of rectangles and triangles.  The area of a rectange is length times width.  The area of a triangle is 0.5 base times height (0.5 x b x h).  The height is defined as the distance along a line perpendicular to the base to the tip of the triangle.  Once you have found the different areas, you add them up.

```
           \                   \                            /\
           | \                  \\                         /   \
           |   \                 \  \                     /     \
   height  |     \                \    \                 /       \
           |       \               \      \             /         \
           |         \              \        \         /           \
           |-----------\             \----------\     /--------------\
              base1                      base2             base3
```

Notice that the above triangles have different bases, but their heights are the same.

This "lab" will be graded as follows:

Score | Criteria
----- | --------
4 | 5 figures are sketched, measured, and areas are estimated accurately.
3 | 5 figures are sketched and measured.  Some areas are estimated accurately.  Or less than 5 figures are sketched, measured, and areas are estimated accurately.
2 | Some figures are sketched, measured, and areas are estimated accurately.
1 | An attempt has been made to sketch, measure, and estimate any of the figures.
0 | No attempt has been made to do the lab.

A multiplier may be given to the lab (2.5) to make it worth more points (10).
