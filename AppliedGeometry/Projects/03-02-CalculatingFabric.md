# Calculating Fabric Project

The [Essential Standards](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/AppliedMathWithMiyoshi/blob/main/AppliedGeometry/EssentialStandards-AppliedGeometry.md) addressed in this project are:

* Model the world mathematically
* Solve complex problems, even those that they have not previously seen
* Use and prepare data for analysis, prediction, and planning

The ways students will meet these standards are by measuring, planning, and calculating the fabric requirements for a glove.

You are going to create a fabric glove for a classmate's hand.  You will create:

* Scale drawing of the right (or left) hand of one person;
* Measurements of the circumferences and lengths of each finger;
* Measurements of the palm area (approximate as a rectangular prism)

You will calculate:

* The surface area of each digit (finger);
* The surface area of the palm area;
* Amount of fabric including 5% waste

## Note

The base of each finger is a circle (approximately), but to find the surface area, you do not need to include both bases.  You only need to calculate the lateral area of the palm area of the hand because the fingers are attached at one end and the other end is open for inserting the hand.  So neither base is needed in the surface area calculation of the palm area.

The elements will have the following points associated with them.

Requirement | Points 
----------- | -----: 
Scale drawing(s) |  2
Measurements of circumferences, lengths, etc. |  4
Area calculations |  8
Amount of fabric needed for a pair of gloves |  2

## Deliverables:

You will make a scale drawing(s) of your glove.  Include the measurements on your drawings.  They will probably be at a scale of 1/2" = 1" or full scale.

### Answer these questions (4):

1. Why do you need to include 5% waste in your calculation of the amount of fabric needed?
1. Fabric is normally sold by the linear yard, but according to the internet, its width can be anywhere from 36" to 60" depending on what type of material.  Suppose that the internet is right and most apparel fabric is 54" wide.  How many pairs of gloves can you make with just one yard of fabric?  Does it matter how you lay out the pattern on the fabric?

### Extension (2):

Find the cost for making 10 pairs of gloves for your classmate.  Choose a fabric and determine how much it will cost for those 10 pairs of gloves.  Determine how much left over material you will have.

## Notes:

This is an individual project.  You can, of course, help each other, but do not just copy each other.

Make your project beautiful.  Use a straight edge and a scale to make your drawings to scale and readable.

The extension is not part of the total.  It can add to your points, but you cannot receive more than the maximum points for the project (per current school policy).

The project shows that it is worth 20 points, but it may be normalized to a different point total.

The [grading rubric](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/AppliedMathWithMiyoshi/blob/main/GradingCriteria.md) will be used to grade each section.
