# Project: Designing a Stained Glass Window

The [Essential Standards](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/AppliedMathWithMiyoshi/blob/main/AppliedGeometry/EssentialStandards-AppliedGeometry.md) addressed in this project are:

* Model the world mathematically
* Have number sense

The ways students will meet these standards are through actually constructing parallel and perpendicular lines, bisecting angles, creating arcs and circles, and doing the other necessary things to create scale drawings and models.  Students will help gain number sense through measuring distances and angles, and through estimating the same.

You are going to design a stained glass window that is a minimum of 6' x 3'.  It must have the following requirements.

* Scale drawing(s);
* Parallel lines;
* Perpendicular lines;
* At least one semicircle;
* At least one bisected angle;
* At least ten pieces.

The elements will have the following points associated with them.

Requirement | Points 
----------- | -----: 
Size (6'x3') |  4
Scale drawing(s) |  4
Parallel Lines |  4
Perpendicular Lines |  4
At least one semicircle |  4
At least one bisected angle |  4
At least 10 pieces |  4
Measure and label each angle of at least 10 of your shapes | 8
(Extension/Extra) Pieces cut from cardboard or paper arranged as designed | 8

## Deliverables:

You will actually make a scale model of your design.  It can either be made full scale or made to a specific scale.  You must write the angle measures on each angle.

You will also have instructions on how to put your design together.

### Answer these questions (4):

This seems to be an art project.  What are some of the important math concepts that you used to create your masterpiece?

What is the importance of knowing what complementary and supplementary angles are?

### Extension (4):

Find the cost of what your stained glass masterpiece would be based on the size and color of the glass you would use.

## Notes:

This is an individual project.  You can, of course, help each other, but do not just copy each other.

Make your project beautiful.  Your graphs and math should be readable with labels and units.  Use a straight edge for your manually created graphs.

The extension is not part of the total.  It can add to your points, but you cannot receive more than the maximum points for the project (per current school policy).

The [grading rubric](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/AppliedMathWithMiyoshi/blob/main/GradingCriteria.md) will be used to grade each section.
