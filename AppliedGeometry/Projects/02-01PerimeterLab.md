# Perimeter Lab

What is perimeter?  Simply put, it is one of two measures of a 2-dimentional (2D) figure.  It is the distance around the edge of the figure.  It is important to know how to calculate the perimeter of an object.  Any object.  A simple example as to why we want to know the perimeter of something is to put up a fence.  Another example is putting a ribbon on a present.  You may not realize that you are finding the perimeter, but you are actually finding two perimeters if you have a 3-dimensional (3D) object.

Materials:

You will need the following:
* Paper
* Writing utensil
* Tape measure
* Objects

You will have several wooden (or other material) objects.  They are 3D, but you are going to find the distance around the outside edges of the main (largest) shape.  You may measure in inches (in) or centimeters (cm) or whatever units the tape measure has.  You will work in groups to gather the data, but you will calculate the distance around (perimeter) on your own.

Notice how the line segments are labeled sequentially (in order) as you go around the figure.

Create a table on your paper with three columns.  The left-most column will be for a sketch of your figure.  The middle column will be a list of all the distances of all the straight edges.  The last column will be the sum of all those distances, which is the perimeter.  The "sum" is just the answer to adding up all the distances.  Label each of the lines of your sketch and have corresponding distances labeled in your second column.

Sketch | Labeled Distances | total of distances
------ | ----------------- | ------------------
Labeled sketch | labeled distances | total distance (perimeter)
Labeled sketch | labeled distances | total distance (perimeter)
Labeled sketch | labeled distances | total distance (perimeter)

Your goal is to sketch, measure, and calculate the perimeter for 10 figures.  My suggestion is to sketch, label, and measure first (in the first half of the class).  Then do the calculations.

This "lab" will be graded as follows:

Score | Criteria
----- | --------
4 | 10 figures are sketched, measured, and perimeters are calculated accurately.
3 | 10 figures are sketched and measured.  Some perimeters are calculated accurately.  Or less than 10 figures are sketched, measured, and perimeters are calculated accurately.
2 | Some figures are sketched, measured, and perimeters are calculated accurately.
1 | An attempt has been made to sketch, measure, and calculate any of the figures.
0 | No attempt has been made to do the lab.

A multiplier may be given to the lab (2.5) to make it worth more points (10).
