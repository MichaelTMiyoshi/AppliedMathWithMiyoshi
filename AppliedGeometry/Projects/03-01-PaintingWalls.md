# Painting Walls Project

The [Essential Standards](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/AppliedMathWithMiyoshi/blob/main/AppliedGeometry/EssentialStandards-AppliedGeometry.md) addressed in this project are:

* Model the world mathematically
* Solve complex problems, even those that they have not previously seen
* Use and prepare data for analysis, prediction, and planning

The ways students will meet these standards are by measuring, planning, and calculating the paint requirements for a room.

You are going to paint a room in your house.  The room must have doors and windows.  You will create:

* Scale drawing(s) of each wall;
* Measurements of heights and widths of walls and openings

You will calculate:

* The area of each wall (minus any openings);
* The amount of paint (in gallons) needed for the project (assume 1.5 - 2 times coverage);

The elements will have the following points associated with them.

Requirement | Points 
----------- | -----: 
Scale drawing(s) |  2
Measurements of wall |  2
Area calculations |  8
Amount of paint calculations (whole gallons) |  4

## Deliverables:

You will make a scale drawing(s) of your walls.  Include the measurements on your drawings.  They will probably be at a scale of 1/4" = 1'.

### Answer these questions (4):

1. Coverage is an important concept.  What do you think 1.5 coverage means?  (What is half a coat of paint?)
1. Paint normally comes in 1-gallon or 5-gallon cans.  If you need over four gallons, do you think it would be cheaper to buy a 5-gallon can instead of 5 1-gallon cans?  What other advantage could you think of in buying a 5-gallon can?

### Extension (2):

Find the cost of painting your room.  Choose a color and determine how much it will cost for that color and the amount of paint you need.

## Notes:

This is an individual project.  You can, of course, help each other, but do not just copy each other.

Make your project beautiful.  Use a straight edge and a scale to make your drawings to scale and readable.

The extension is not part of the total.  It can add to your points, but you cannot receive more than the maximum points for the project (per current school policy).

The project shows that it is worth 20 points, but it may be normalized to a different point total.

The [grading rubric](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/AppliedMathWithMiyoshi/blob/main/GradingCriteria.md) will be used to grade each section.
