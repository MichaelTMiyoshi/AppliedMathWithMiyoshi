# What Is PI? Lab

What is PI?  First of all PI is a Greek letter.  It is the sixteenth letter in the Greek alphabet.  But what about PI in terms of math?  What is it and why is it important?

Materials:

You will need the following:
* Paper
* Writing utensil
* Tape measure
* String
* Circular objects (toilet paper rolls, cans, bottles, etc.)

You will have cylindrical objects.  They are 3D, but you are going to find the distance around the circular part of the shape.  Hopefully, you recall that the distance around the outside of a 2D shape is called the perimeter.  To confuse you a little, this perimeter around a circle has a special name.  It is called circumference.  But remember, it is still just the distance around.  Circumference is still just a perimeter.  (While you can use circumference and perimeter interchangably for a circle, you may not do so for non circular shapes.)  You may measure in inches (in) or centimeters (cm) or whatever units the tape measure has.  You will work in groups to gather the data, but you will do the calculations on your own.

Create a table on your paper with three columns.  The left-most column will be for the circumference measurement.  The middle column will be for the diameter of the same circular object.  The last column will be ratio (division) of the circumference and the diameter.  (In other words, divide the circumference by the diameter.)

Circumference (perimeter) | Diameter | Circumference / Diameter
------ | ----------------- | ------------------
Labeled sketch | labeled distances | total distance (perimeter)
Labeled sketch | labeled distances | total distance (perimeter)
Labeled sketch | labeled distances | total distance (perimeter)

You are going to take two measurements.  The first measurement is the circumference.  Take a string and wrap it one time around the circular part of the object.  Measure this distance (the circumference is the length of the string) and write it in the first column.  Put units at the top of the table (as long as you are consistent).

Next, measure the distance across the widest point of your circle.  This is called the diameter.  (Radius is halfway across.  It is half the diameter.)  Put this distance in the second column of your paper.

Finally, calculate the circumference divided by the diameter.  This is also called a ratio.

Answer the following questions:

1. What do you notice about the ratios of the different circles?
2. Why do you think that is?
3. This lab is titled "What is PI?"  Why do you think that is?
4. Besides being the sixteenth letter in the Greek alphabet, what is PI?  (Related to math.)
5. What formula can you create from the data?

This "lab" will be graded as follows:

Score | Criteria
----- | --------
4 | 10 circular figures measured (circumference and diamter) and ratio calculated accurately.  All questions all answered reasonably.
3 | 10 circular figures measured (circumference and diamter) and ratio calculated somewhat accurately.  Or less than 10 figures measured and calculated accurately.  All questions answered somewhat reasonably or not all questions answered.
2 | Some circular figures measured (circumference and diamter) and ratio calculated somewhat accurately.  Questions attempted.
1 | An attempt has been made to measure and calculate.  An attempt has also been made to answer the questions reasonably.
0 | No attempt has been made to do the lab or answer the questions.

A multiplier may be given to the lab (5) to make it worth more points (200).  (Perhaps more.)
