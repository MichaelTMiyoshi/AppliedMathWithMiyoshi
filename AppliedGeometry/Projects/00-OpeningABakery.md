# Opening a Bakery Project

You  are planning to open a bakery.  And you want to start with your favorite cookie.  Which means that you need your favorite cookie recipe.  The problem is that you are going to need to be able to scale that recipe up so that you can order your supplies.  And you are going to need to be able to scale down your recipe to figure out how many ingredients are in each cookie so you can (if need be) figure out nutritional information per cookie.

Find a cookie recipe with at least ten ingredients.  (Or if your recipe has less than ten ingredients, you can use enough recipes that total ten ingredients.)  Your product will include lists, graphs, and charts, and the math that gets you to them.  Plus, it will include answering a few questions.

Start with the list of ingredients and their amounts.  Below is a list of ingredients for [NESTLÉ®](https://www.nestle.com/) [TOLL HOUSE® Cookies](https://www.verybestbaking.com/toll-house/recipes/original-nestle-toll-house-chocolate-chip-cookies/).  Which you can modify for your own use (for instance, I usually use 2 to 3 teaspoons of vanilla).  Or, as already noted, you can use your own cookie recipe (or ingredients).

| Amount | Ingredient |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 2 ¼ cup | Flour |
| 1 teaspoon | Baking soda |
| 1 teaspoon | Salt |
| 1 cup (2 sticks) (½ pound) | Butter |
| ¾ cup | Granulated sugar |
| ¾ cup | Brown sugar |
| 1 teaspoon | Vanilla extract |
| 2 | Large eggs |
| 2 cups | NESTLÉ® Semi-sweet chocolate morsels |
| 1 cup | Chopped walnuts (optional) |

When I make this chocolate chip cookie recipe, I usually get 55 cookies.  (Actually, I usually get 52 cookies, plus three dough balls.  You are not supposed to eat raw dough because you are not supposed to eat raw eggs.)  I would simplify this amount to 50 cookies for the sake of this project.

## Deliverables:

### Create a table for each ingredient (20).
This table should be something like the following:

| Number of cookies | Amount (units) | Conversion units |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1 | | |
| 50 (or amount of one batch) | | |
| 100 | | |
| 500 | | |
| 1000 | | |
| 10000 | | |

The conversion column will be in appropriate units for large batches.  For flour, sugar, brown sugar, and such, you should convert to pounds.  Which means that you will need to look up conversions from cups to pound (for instance).  The appropriate conversion for liquid measure will probably be in gallons.

You may choose to use metric units for this project, but you will not get as much practice in fraction operations as you will with Imperial units (the measurements given in this example).

For your convenience, here are a few conversions.

| Example Conversions |
| ------------------- |
| 1 cup flour weighs 0.276 pounds |
| 1 cup sugar weighs 0.440 pounds |
| 1 cup brown sugar weighs 0.440 pounds |
| 768 teaspoons in one gallon (liquid) |
| 1 teaspoon of salt weighs 0.0139 pounds |

### Create a graph for each ingredient.  (20)
This graph will have as its x-value the number of cookies from 0 through 12 (one dozen).  The y-value will be the ingredient amount.

### Create a graph for each ingredient for each ingredient for up to 10000 cookies.  (20)
You may use excel to create this graph or you may draw it by hand.  Find from the graph the amount of each ingredient at each 1000 cookies (just label the x- and y-values on the graph).

### Show the math (30):

Show the math for your calculations.  Specifically, show the math for calculating the amount of each ingredient per cookie and for calculating the amount of each ingredient for a dozen cookies and 1000 cookies.  (Do calculations and verify with the graphs.  Or do the calculations to create the graphs.)

### Answer these questions (10):

If you assume a fixed amount of waste of each ingredient, how does that affect each graph?
If you assume a certain percentage of waste for each ingredient, how does that affect each graph?
How can you use your graphs as quality control?  (Think of inequalities.)

### Extension (10):

Find the cost of ingredients to make 10000 cookies.  (See if you can find discounts for bulk.  Note your sources.)  What price per cookie should you charge just to cover the cost of ingredients?

## Notes:

This is an individual project.  You can, of course, help each other, but do not just copy each other.  (I would actually prefer that everybody in the class does a different recipe.)

You may choose to do a recipe or recipes for something other than a cookie (you might be opening a restaurant instead of a bakery).  Just remember that you need to have at least 10 ingredients total in your recipe(s).

Make your project beautiful.  Your graphs and math should be readable with labels and units.  Use a straight edge for your manually created graphs.

The extension is not part of the total.  It can add to your points, but you cannot receive more than the maximum points for the project (per current school policy).

The [grading rubric](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/AppliedMathWithMiyoshi/blob/main/GradingCriteria.md) will be used to grade each section.
