# Opening a Bakery Project

You  are planning to open a bakery.  And you want to start with your favorite cookie.  Which means that you need your favorite cookie recipe.  The problem is that you are going to need to be able to scale that recipe up so that you can order your supplies.  And you are going to need to be able to scale down your recipe to figure out how many ingredients are in each cookie so you can (if need be) figure out nutritional information per cookie.

Find a cookie recipe with at least ten ingredients.  (Or if your recipe has less than ten ingredients, you can use two recipes that total ten ingredients.)  Your product will include lists, graphs, and charts, and the math that gets you to them.

Start with the list of ingredients and their amounts.  Below is a list of ingredients for [NESTLÉ®](https://www.nestle.com/) [TOLL HOUSE® Cookies](https://www.verybestbaking.com/toll-house/recipes/original-nestle-toll-house-chocolate-chip-cookies/).  Which you can modify for your own use (for instance, I usually use 2 to 3 teaspoons of vanilla), or you can use your own cookie ingredients.

| Amount | Ingredient |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 2 ¼ cup | Flour |
| 1 teaspoon | Baking soda |
| 1 teaspoon | Salt |
| 1 cup (2 sticks) (½ pound) | Butter |
| ¾ cup | Granulated sugar |
| ¾ cup | Brown sugar |
| 1 teaspoon | Vanilla extract |
| 2 | Large eggs |
| 2 cups | NESTLÉ® Semi-sweet chocolate morsels |
| 1 cup | Chopped walnuts (optional) |
