# Fill the gaps project

There are certain prerequisite knowledge and skills necessary to be successful in any math class.  This project is to help the students fill the gaps that they might have and to help them to realize that they can help each other fill those gaps.

Students will create lessons to help their fellow students fill in the gaps that they might have in their previous mathematics learning.  They will do so by creating a lesson about one of those gaps in learning.

These lessons must have the following aspects in the form of a presentation to the class:

* Explain the concept/skill, including how the concept applies to more than just mathematics (explain how knowing the concept/skill applies to life)
* Give mathematical example problems and solutions
* Give practice problems and solutions (minimum of 3)
* Give evaluation problems (and solutions) that students might see in a test (minimum of 3)

Note: The evaluations problems and solutions may be similar in nature to the practice problems.  Often test problems are slight variations of practice problems.

### Rubric

Each section will be graded by the following criteria.  The explanation and examples will have the most weight (2x to 3x that of the problems).

Score | Percent | Description
----- | ------- | -----------
0- | 0 | No attempt made.
0+ | 50 | An honest effort to is given, but explanation or example is incorrect.  Major corrections/additions are needed during the presentation.
1 | 62.5% | Indeterminate.  Somewhere between an honest effort and incomplete.
2 | 75% | Explanation or example is incomplete.  Corrections/additions are needed during the presentation.
3 | 87.5% | Explanation or example nearly complete/correct.  Minor corrections are needed during the presentation.
4 | 100% | Explanation or example is complete and understandable.  Problems and solutions are correct.
