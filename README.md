# AppliedMathWithMiyoshi

This repository holds Applied Math assignments, grading criteria, competencies (skills), labs, projects, and much more.  Of course, texts and other copyrighted materials will not be listed here (unless I hold the copyrights).

This repository has two main directories.  One for Applied Geometry.  One for Applied Algebra 2.  This readme.md file and other files in this common area are for common documents, grading criteria explanations, and the like.

## Note to teachers
If you are a teacher of Applied Mathematics, specifically Applied Geometry and/or Applied Algebra 2, this is written permission to use my stuff.  Please give attribution for what you use directly and what you modify.  Pointing people to my repository (or the particular resource) is a good way to do that.
