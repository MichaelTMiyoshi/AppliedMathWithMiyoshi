# First Graded Project

Okay.  Project is probably a bit overstated, but this is the first graded thing for my Applied Mathematics courses.  It is a bit of writing.  Oh yes.  I said writing.  Now before you groan and fuss too much, know that in almost any job you do, you will do some sort of writing.  It may not be an essay (like this one ought to be), but it might be.  You will do some sort of writing in any job you do.  So quit complaining.  Just do the writing.

What are you going to write?  I am glad you asked.

Many people do not like math.  (I am not one of them.)  The reason many of them do not like math is because they do not see the relevance to them.  They do not see why it applies to their everyday life or their job.  They think it too abstract.  So here is the project.

I want you to give me three reasons you want to learn applied mathematics.  The particular mathematics you are about to learn.  And I want you to justify your reasons with concrete justifications.  Specifics.

For instance, you might say:

* I want to learn how geometry applies to art so I can understand perspective and other mathematical nuances.
* I want to learn algebra so that I can apply my mathematical skills to creating different budget scenarios.

I would like a bit more detail for your reasons, but the above examples are a starting point.  Maybe just a little shy in the justifications department.  (By the way, if the above are legitimate for you, you may certainly use them.)

Grading for this follows the normal grading criteria.  It is just that instead of the answer and solving the problem, you have an answer and its justification.  There are three reasons and justifications, so the points will be the equivalent of having three four-point problems.  (Which may or may not mean that the project is worth 12 points.)

By the way, this project may be the only thing in the gradebook for a little bit, so you want to make sure you do it.

I forgot one last thing.  You may do this from the negative side.  Tell me three reasons why you do not think you need to learn the particular math you are going to learn.  The reasons and justifications may not be that you hate math.  You may certainly say that you hate math, but you need to give justifications as to why.  Why do you specifically hate math?  Again, you must back up what you say with actual reasons.  Justify what you say or it is just fluff.  No substance.

And if you would like to mix and match, you may do that as well.  In other words, you can say a couple positive and a negative or a couple negatives and a positive.  And you may always do more than three.  Just not less.

Oops.  One more last thing.

Make sure that your language is appropriate.  Not just for my sake, but because I might ask you to share at least one of your reasons with the class.

Scoring for each response and justification

Score | Percent | Description
----- | ------- | -----------
0- | 0 | No answer given.
0+ | 50 | An honest effort to explain is given.
1 | 62.5% | Reason is given without justification.
2 | 75% | Reason is given with minimal justification.
3 | 87.5% | Reason is given with some justification.
4 | 100% | Reason is given with ample justification.
